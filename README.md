# e-commerce_website

This is a simple e-commerce sample website. It is pure front-end with the shopping cart using javascript variables. Everything 'works' but will lose the data if you reload the page. not using localstorage because i don't think that would be used in the real world anyway.

The numbers are strings in the html but I parseInt to do calculations. there are lot of click eventlisteners that trigger these calculations.
